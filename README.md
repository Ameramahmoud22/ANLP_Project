1. Define the Problem:
   We aim to build an NLP system for Question Answering (QA).
   The task focuses on developing a model that can understand questions written in natural language and generate accurate and relevant answers from a given text corpus.

This falls under the broader domain of Natural Language Understanding (NLU), requiring the system to comprehend both the semantics of the question and the content of the source text.

2. Task Description: Question Answering
   Overview:
   Question Answering (QA) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves automatically providing answers to questions expressed in human language.
   The main objective is to build a system capable of:

Understanding the meaning and context of the question.

Searching or reasoning over a given text corpus.

Producing an answer that is accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate.

There are different types of QA tasks, including:

Extractive QA: The system finds a span of text directly from the corpus.

Abstractive QA: The system generates a new answer based on understanding, not necessarily a direct quote.

Open-domain QA: The system searches from a very large corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) rather than a fixed small set of documents.

Why is it challenging?

Questions can be asked in many different forms.

Understanding requires capturing deep semantics, not just keywords.

Answers may need to combine information from multiple parts of the text.
